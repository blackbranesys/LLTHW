## Lisp References on the Web

* [Common Lisp HyperSpec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm), an interactive version of the language reference document for Common Lisp.
* [Common Lisp Cookbook](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/index.html), a list of useful Lisp recipes. Also contains a list of other online sources of CL information.
* [cliki.net](http://cliki.net), the Common Lisp Wiki. A great resource for all things CL. Has a [Getting Started](http://cliki.net/Getting+Started) page and an extensive list of [Lisp books](http://cliki.net/Lisp%20books).
* [common-lisp.net](http://common-lisp.net/)
* [Where to learn how to practically use Common Lisp](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7224823/where-to-learn-how-to-practically-use-common-lisp?noredirect=1&lq=1), a question on StackOverflow, with many useful links in the answers.

## Lisp Books on the Web

These are books that are freely accessible online.

* [Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/), a good introduction to CL for experienced programmers, which tries to highlight from the very beginning what makes CL different to other languages.
* [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/), a good introduction for people new to programming.
* [Common Lisp: An interactive approach by Stuart C. Shapiro](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Commonlisp/), was used as a course textbook, course notes accompany the book on the website.
* [Common Lisp, the Language by Guy L. Steele](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html), a description of the Common Lisp language. According to the [CLiki](http://cliki.net/Getting+Started) it is outdated, but it contains better descriptions of the [loop macro](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node235.html#SECTION003000000000000000000) and [format](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node200.html) than the Common Lisp Hyperspec does.
* [On Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html), a great book for intermediately experienced Lispers.
* [Let Over Lambda by Doug Hoyte](http://letoverlambda.com/), [several people reccomend](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/3actsc/let_over_lambda/) that you be comfortable with On Lisp before reading this book, and that the start is slow. A very in-depth look at macros.


## Other Books on Lisp

* [ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html)
* [Common Lisp Recipes by Edmund Weitz](http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/)
* [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming](http://norvig.com/paip.html), has many interesting applications of Lisp, but is not a good reference for AI any more.
* The Little Lisper
* Land of Lisp
* Lisp in Small Pieces

## Lisp Libraries

* [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/), a package management platform for Lisp libraries.
* [Quickdocs](http://quickdocs.org/), documentation for projects in Quicklisp

## Pre-packages Lisp Environments

These are Lisp editing environments that are easy to install and get started with because everything you need is pre-packaged and pre-configured.
* [Portacle](https://shinmera.github.io/portacle/) is a portable and multiplatform Common Lisp environment. It ships a slightly customized Emacs with Slime, SBCL (a popular Common Lisp implementation), Quicklisp and Git. No installation needed, so it's a very quick and easy way to get going.
* [Lispbox](https://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/) is an IDE (Emacs + SLIME), Common Lisp environment (Clozure Common Lisp) and library manager (Quicklisp), pre-packaged as archives for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Descendant of "Lisp in a Box" Recommended in the Practical Common Lisp book.
