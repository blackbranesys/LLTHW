# Lists and List Operations

> "While the laws of statistics tell you how unlikely a particular coincidence is, they state just as firmly that coincidences <em>do happen</em>."

In the spirit of Lambda Calculus and a pure functional heritage, the Lisp-family of programming languages gets its name from its purpose---*LISt Processing*.  Even though Common Lisp is not a purely-functional programming language, its fundamental syntax has not deviated from this heritage; as you should remember from Chapter 1.1, Cons-Cells are one of two essential forms of Expressions in Lisp, and they are represented using List syntax; and since the other---Atoms---are, by definition, self-evaluating, everything interesting that you can do in Lisp is *effectively* a List operation.  And these are divided into *consing* and *non-consing* operations.

This is important to remember---it's the reason there are *so many* parentheses in Lisp source-code.  Every form surrounded by parentheses is a list. The only difference between code and data, syntactically speaking, is that *code is read and evaluated* whereas *data is only read*; you can switch to "data mode" by quoting an expression, but quoting isn't a free pass.  Lisp still expects to be able to *Read* the forms you've quoted as valid forms, so the syntax is just as important to data as it is to code.

This is also the key to Lisp's homoiconicity---the same syntax is used to represent both Code and Data, and as a result you can treat Code as Data, and Data as Code.  As far as Lisp is concerned, there is no difference between the two.

But Lists are also a proper type in Common Lisp, that descends from sequences.  We have already seen some sequence operations on other data types, like Strings, and will explore them further.  However, in this chapter, we will focus on Lists as a proper data type and Consing operations on these Lists.

## Exercise 1.4.1

**Cons-Cells**

Cons-Cells are the smallest compound data structure in Lisp. A Cons-Cell is effectively a pair of pointers. You can tell if what you're looking at is a Cons-Cell by using the predicate `consp`.

```lisp
* (consp 5)
NIL

* (consp "a")
NIL

* (consp 'a)
NIL

* (consp (cons 'a 'b))
T
```

## Exercise 1.4.2

**Consing**

One way to create a Cons-Cell is using the `cons` function.

```lisp
* (cons 'a 'b)
(A . B)
```

They can hold any `type` of data, not just symbols.

```lisp
* (cons 1 2)
(1 . 2)

* (cons "one" "two")
("one" . "two")
```

## Exercise 1.4.3

**Dot-Notation**

You can see that when we cons two atoms together, we get back a Dotted Pair. This is a `read`able representation of Cons-Cells. That is, you can use it directly, rather than calling `cons`.

```lisp
* (cons 'a 'b)
(A . B)

* '(a . b)
(A . B)
```

These two representations are equivalent.

```lisp
* (equal (cons 'a 'b) '(a . b))
T
```

## Exercise 1.4.4

**More Consing**

Cons-Cells need not contain homogenous data.

```lisp
* (cons 'a 2)
(A . 2)

* (cons 1 "two")
(1 . "two")

* (cons "a" 'b)
("a" . B)
```

## Exercise 1.4.5

**CAR and CDR**

Using Cons-Cells as building blocks would be kind of pointless if we couldn't get their components back out. To get the value of the first slot in a Cons-Cell, we use the `car` function.

```lisp
* (cons 'a 'b)
(A . B)

* (car (cons 'a 'b))
A
```

Similarly, we can get the value from the second slot in a Cons-Cell using `cdr`.

```lisp
* (cons 1 2)
(1 . 2)

* (cdr (cons 1 2))
2
```

## Exercise 1.4.6

**More CAR and CDR**

`cons`, `car` and `cdr` are purely functional. Which means they never mutate their arguments.

```lisp
* (defvar *a* (cons 1 2))
*A*

* *a*
(1 . 2)

* (cdr *a*)
2

* *a*
(1 . 2)

* (cons 3 (cdr *a*))
(3 . 2)

* *a*
(1 . 2)
```

It is an error to use `car` and `cdr` on something other than a Cons-Cell.

```lisp
* (car 1)
; Evaluation aborted on #<TYPE-ERROR expected-type: LIST datum: 1>

* (cdr 'a)
; Evaluation aborted on #<TYPE-ERROR expected-type: LIST datum: A>.
```

This includes other compound values such as strings and vectors

```lisp
* (car "a")
; Evaluation aborted on #<TYPE-ERROR expected-type: LIST datum: "a">.

* (cdr #(1 2))
; Evaluation aborted on #<TYPE-ERROR expected-type: LIST datum: #<(SIMPLE-VECTOR 2) {1007D4C76F}>>.
```

but not the empty list, also represented as `NIL`

```lisp
* (car nil)
NIL

* (cdr nil)
NIL

* (car ())
NIL

* (cdr ())
NIL
```

## Exercise 1.4.7


**Lists**

A list is either the empty list, or a chain of Cons-Cells ending with the empty list.

```lisp
* (listp nil)
T

* (listp (cons 5 nil))
T
```
If you cons something onto the empty list, you get the list of that thing.

```lisp
* (cons 5 nil)
(5)
```
We can exploit the Cons-Cells' ability to contain heterogenous data in order to represent linked lists or trees.

```lisp
* (cons 3 (cons 2 (cons 1 nil)))
(3 2 1)
```

## Exercise 1.4.8

**More Lists**

Another way to create lists is using the `list` function.

```lisp
* (list 3 2 1)
(3 2 1)
```

The expression `(list a b ...)` is effectively shorthand for the expression `(cons a (cons b ...))`, with the final value being `cons`ed onto `NIL`.

```lisp
* (list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)

* (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
(1 2 3)

* (equal (list 1 2 3) (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))))
T
```

As with `cons`, it's possible to build up trees, rather than merely lists, using `list`.

```lisp
* (list 1 (list 2 3) (list 4 (list (list 5) 6 7 8)))
(1 (2 3) (4 ((5) 6 7 8)))
```

## Exercise 1.4.9

**Even More CAR and CDR**

Because `car` and `cdr` are purely functional, and return their target value, it's possible to chain them in order to look into nested structures.

```lisp
* (cons (cons 1 2) 3)
((1 . 2) . 3)

* (car (car (cons (cons 1 2) 3)))
1
```

This also applies to deeply nested lists.

```lisp
* (defparameter *tree* (list 1 (list 2 3) (list 4 (list (list 5) 6 7 8))))
*tree*

* *tree*
(1 (2 3) (4 ((5) 6 7 8)))

* (car (cdr (car (cdr *tree*))))
3
```

This is common enough that Lisp supports shorthand for such tree selections.

```lisp
* (car *tree*)
1

* (cadr *tree*)

(2 3)

* (cadadr *tree*)
3

* (cddr *tree*)
((4 ((5) 6 7 8)))

* (cdddr *tree*)
NIL
```

They're actual functions though. Not a reader syntax based on the number of `a`s and `d` s between the `c` and `r`. So, for instance:

```lisp
* (caddadddaaar *tree*)
   The function COMMON-LISP-USER::CADDADDDAAAR is undefined.
      [Condition of type UNDEFINED-FUNCTION]
```

## Exercise 1.4.10

**Push and Pop**

We mentioned before that `cons`, `car`, `cdr` and friends are purely functional. But, sometimes, you want to destructively modify a list you've defined. For instance, in order to implement a mutable stack. In order to destructively `cons` elements onto a list, use `push`.

```lisp
* (defvar *stack* nil)
*stack*

* (push 1 *stack*)
(1)

* *stack*
(1)

* (push 2 *stack*)
(2 1)

* (push 3 *stack*)
(3 2 1)

* *stack*
(3 2 1)
```

## Exercise 1.4.11

**Pop**

The other half of the a stack involves destructively removing the first element from it. This can be done with `pop`.

```lisp
* *stack*
(3 2 1)

* (pop *stack*)
3

* *stack*
(2 1)

* (pop *stack*)
2

* (pop *stack*)
1

* *stack*
NIL
```

Calling `pop` on an empty list has no effect.

```lisp
* *stack*
NIL

* (pop *stack*)
NIL

* *stack*
NIL
```

## Exercise 1.4.12

**More Push and Pop**

Like `cons`, `push` isn't limited to the existing type of its target.

```lisp
* *stack*
NIL

* (push 1 *stack*)
(1)

* (push "b" *stack*)
("b" 1)

* (push 'c *stack*)
(c "b" 1)

* (push (list 4 5) *stack*)
((4 5) C "a" 1)

* *stack*
((4 5) C "a" 1)
```

## Exercise 1.4.13

**First, Rest, and Last**

In addition to `car` and `cdr`, it's also possible to manipulate Cons-Cells using the `first` and `rest` functions. They're just different names for the same functions. `first` is the same as `car`

```lisp
* (cons 'a 'b)
(A . B)

* (car (cons 'a 'b))
A

* (first (cons 'a 'b))
A
```

and `rest` is the same as `cdr`

```lisp
* (cons 1 2)
(1 . 2)

* (cdr (cons 1 2))
2

* (rest (cons 1 2))
2
```

A third function, `last`, lets you get at the last Cons-Cell in a particular series.

```lisp
* (last (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))))
(3)

* (last (cons 1 2))
(1 . 2)

* (last (list 3 4 5))
(5)
```

## Exercise 1.4.14

**List Position**

When dealing with linked lists, if you want to get at a particular element somewhere in the middle, you could either chain some `car`s and `cdr`s.

```lisp
* (car (cdr (cdr (cdr (list 0 1 2 3 4 5)))))
3

* (cadddr (list 0 1 2 3 4 5))
3
```

or you could use the `nth` function.

```lisp
* (nth 3 (list 0 1 2 3 4 5))
3

* (nth 4 (list 0 1 2 3 4 5))
4

* (nth 5 (list 5 4 3 2 1 0))
0
```

This isn't any more efficient (in the run-time sense) than `cdr` traversal, but is shorter to write if you need to access some deeper list element in a flat list.

## Exercise 1.4.15

**Appending**

Putting lists together is the job of the `append` function.

```lisp
* (append (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6))
(1 2 3 4 5 6)

* (append (list 6 5 4 3) (list 2 1))
(6 5 4 3 2 1)
```

`append` is an example of a function that takes a `&rest` argument. Meaning you can pass it any number of lists...

```lisp
* (append (list 'a 'b 'c 'd) (list 'e 'f) (list 'g))
(A B C D E F G)

* (append (list 1) (list 2) (list 3) (list 4))
(1 2 3 4)
```

...though passing it one list is pointless.

```lisp
* (append (list 1 2 3))
(1 2 3)

* (list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```
## Exercise 1.4.16

**More Appending**

Like `car`, `cdr`, `first`, `rest`, `last` and `nth`, `append` is functional. It will return a new list rather than mutating any of its arguments.

```lisp
* (defvar *lst* (list 1 2 3 4 5))
*lst*

* *lst*
(1 2 3 4 5)

* (append *lst* (list 6 7 8))
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

* *lst*
(1 2 3 4 5)

* (append (list -3 -2 -1 0) *lst*)
(-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5)

* *lst*
(1 2 3 4 5)

* (append (list 0) *lst* (list 6))
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6)

* *lst*
(1 2 3 4 5)
```

This means both that you may safely pass it any data you want appended without worrying about losing the original lists, and that if you want such behavior, you need to explicitly assign the result of `append` yourself.


## Exercise 1.4.17

**Circular Lists**

The destructive equivalent of `append` is `nconc`. Using such side-effects, it's possible to create circular lists.

```lisp
* (defparameter *cycle* (list 'a 'b))
*CYCLE*

* (first *cycle*)
A

* (second *cycle*)
B

* (third *cycle*)
NIL

* (fourth *cycle*)
NIL
```

Before we create an actual cycle, we need to tell the interpreter to print them (otherwise the request to print a circular list would never return; unlike Haskell, Common Lisp is not a lazy language by default).

```lisp
* (setf *print-circle* t)
T

* (nconc *cycle* *cycle*)
#1=(A B . #1#)

* (third *cycle*)
A

* (fourth *cycle*)
B

* (loop repeat 15 for elem in *cycle* collect elem)
(A B A B A B A B A B A B A B A)
```

## Exercise 1.4.18

**Circular Trees**

The `nconc` procedure is fine when all you want is a simple cycle, but it's also possible to use direct mutation to create more elaborate structures.

```lisp
* (defparameter *knot* (list 1 2 3 4 (cons nil nil)))
*KNOT*

* (setf (car (nth 4 *knot*)) (cdr *knot*))
#1=(1 2 3 4 (#1#))

* (setf (cdr (nth 4 *knot*)) (cddr *knot*))
#1=(3 4 ((1 2 . #1#) . #1#))
```

Now we've got a structure that branches back on itself twice.

```lisp
* (defun cycle-walk (count cycle &key (turn #'car))
    (loop with place = cycle 
          repeat count for elem = (car place) 
          unless (consp elem) do (format t "~a " elem)
          do (setf place (if (consp elem)
			                 (funcall turn elem)
			                 (cdr place)))))
CYCLE-WALK

* (cycle-walk 25 *knot* :turn #'car)
1 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 
NIL

* (cycle-walk 25 *knot* :turn #'cdr)
1 2 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 
NIL

* (let ((dir)) 
    (defun switch (pair)
      (setf dir (not dir))
      (if dir 
	      (car pair)
	      (cdr pair))))
SWITCH

* (cycle-walk 25 *knot* :turn #'switch)
1 2 3 4 3 4 2 3 4 3 4 2 3 4 3 4 2 3 4 
NIL
```

Of course, it's possible to go further. Large, divergent "trees" that eventually cycle backwards from any number of branches at arbitrary depths. You'd build them the same way though; using some combination of `nconc`, `setf` along with `car`/`cdr` and friends.


## Exercise 1.4.19

**Quoting**

Another way to construct tree structure is using the `quote` or `'`.

```lisp
* (quote (1 2 3))
(1 2 3)

* '(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)

* (list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```

The structures you create this way are equivalent.

```lisp
* (equal (quote (1 2 3)) '(1 2 3))
T

* (equal '(1 2 3) (list 1 2 3))
T
```

The difference is that, while `list` essentially means "Return the list of these arguments", `quote`/`'` means "Return this argument without evaluating it".

```lisp
* (defparameter *test* 2)
*test*

* (list 1 *test* 3)
(1 2 3)

* '(1 *test* 3)
(1 *test* 3)

* (list (+ 3 4) (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))
(7 11 15)

* '((+ 3 4) (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))
((+ 3 4) (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))
```

## Exercise 1.4.20

**More Quoting**

Because `quote` supresses evaluation, you can use it to more easily build deeply nested structures.

```lisp
* (list 1 (list 2 3) (list 4 (list (list 5) 6 7 8)))
(1 (2 3) (4 ((5) 6 7 8)))

* '(1 (2 3) (4 ((5) 6 7 8)))
(1 (2 3) (4 ((5) 6 7 8)))
```

Take care not to use quoted data for mutation though. While the structures produced may be the same, mutating a quoted structure is undefined by the Common Lisp language spec, and is thus entirely implementation dependant.

```lisp
* (defvar *listed* (list 3 2 1))
*listed*

* (defvar *quoted* '(3 2 1))
*quoted*

* (push 4 *listed*)
(4 3 2 1)

* *listed*
(4 3 2 1)

* (push 4 *quoted*)
???

* *quoted*
???
```

The question marks aren't there so you can figure out what the results are supposed to be. They signify that what you get back in these situations depends on which implementation of Common Lisp you're using. They may do incompatible things, but because the spec leaves this situation undefined, none of them are actually wrong. So, you know ... careful.
