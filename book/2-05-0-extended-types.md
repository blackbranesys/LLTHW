# Extended Types

Besides the data types we've already seen---strings, integers, floats, complex numbers, vectors, arrays, lists, first-class functions, structs and CLOS classes---Common Lisp has a diverse set of specialized types to serve almost every need.

Many of these specialized data types have their own set of functions for working with them.  While introducing each type, I will also be covering that type's specialized function interface, and various methods of type conversion.

Where the ANSI standard falls short of your needs, it provides a mature and rich type definition system.  You can also, if needs must, mercilessly abuse CLOS to define your more complicated, structured types with classes---which also allows you to use generic functions and methods to provide operator overloading for them.
