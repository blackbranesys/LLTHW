# Look-up Lists and Trees

> "Take sides! Always take sides! You will sometimes be wrong&mdash;but the man who refuses to take sides must <em>always</em> be wrong."
> <footer>Robert A. Heinlein, <em>Double Star</em></footer>

In addition to the typical lists you saw throughout the exercises of the previous chapter, Lisp also has a couple special types of look-up lists that have more structure than just position.  They are called Association Lists and Property Lists, or `alists` and `plists` for short.  They are typically used for data and not code, because they both consist of key--value pairs; but this is Lisp, after all, so there are packages where these special data lists are repurposed as code, and later on you'll see how to do similar things yourself if you ever need or want to.

If you have never come across the concept of key--value pair data structures before, they are straightforward to use and understand---all they do is assign a value you specify to a keyword, so that you can add them to a list and get the value back later by name instead of having to remember where in the list you put the value.  They are the basis for all structured data, including types such as Hash Tables, Structs, Classes, Database Tables, and more, all of which we'll be covering in this book.

This chapter will contain exercises on:

## Exercise 1.5.1

**Lookups: ALISTs and PLISTs**

`alist`s and `plist`s are two basic ways of representing linear-lookup key--value structures. An `alist` is a list of cons cells

```lisp
* '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))
((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3))
```

while a `plist` is a flat list of expressions, whose every odd element is a key and every even element is a value.

```lisp
* (list 'a 1 'b 2 'c 3)
(A 1 B 2 C 3)
```

Both constructs are of type `list`.

```lisp
* (listp '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
T

* (listp (list 'a 1 'b 2 'c 3))
T
```

Which is a double-edged blessing; any general list-processing function can transparently take `alist`s or `plist`s as arguments, but it's not easy to tell whether a particular construct is a plain `list` or a `plist`/`alist` (and there are cases where you *want* to treat them differently).

## Exercise 1.5.2

**PLISTs**

A `plist` is just a flat list with an even number of elements. Each odd element is taken to be the key of the immediately following element.

```lisp
* (list 'a 1 'b 2)
(A 1 B 2)

* (list :foo "a" :bar "b")
(:FOO "a" :BAR "b")
```

Calling the function `getf` on a `plist` and a key will try to find that key in the `plist`. If it is found, the return value will be that keys' value.

```lisp
* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b") :bar)
"b"

* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b") :foo)
"a"
```

The `getf` function also takes an optional argument, `default`, which it will return if the given key is not found in the given `plist`. The default `default` is `NIL`.

```lisp
* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b") :mumble)
NIL

* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b") :mumble 'great-googly-moogly)
GREAT-GOOGLY-MOOGLY
```

Trying this on an odd-length list might give you an error, even if you specify a default value.

```lisp
* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b" :baz) :foo)
"a"

* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b" :baz) :mumble)

  malformed property list: (:FOO "a" :BAR "b" :BAZ).
     [Condition of type SIMPLE-TYPE-ERROR]

* (getf (list :foo "a" :bar "b" :baz) :mumble 'tralala)

  malformed property list: (:FOO "a" :BAR "b" :BAZ).
     [Condition of type SIMPLE-TYPE-ERROR]
```

## Exercise 1.5.3

**More PLISTs**

Like all Cons-Cells, a `plist` can be heterogenously typed. That is, you can put many different types of things in it.

```lisp
* (list :a 1 :b 'two :c "three")
(:A 1 :B TWO :C "three")

* (getf (list :a 1 :b 'two :c "three") :b)
TWO

* (getf (list :a 1 :b 'two :c "three") :c)
"three"
```

This goes for the keys, as well as the values.

```lisp
* (list 1 :a 'two :b "three" :c)
(1 :A TWO :B "three" :C)

* (getf (list 1 :a 'two :b "three" :c) 1)
:A

* (getf (list 1 :a 'two :b "three" :c) 'two)
:B
```

However, be careful. `getf` tests its keys by pointer equality, and there's no way to specify otherwise. Which means that you can't *really* use compound structures as keys in a `plist`.

```lisp
* (getf (list 1 :a 'two :b "three" :c) "three")
NIL
```

Because it's a flat list, you can add keys to an existing `plist` using `cons` or `append`.

```lisp
* (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)
(:A 1 :B 2 :C 3)

* (let ((plist (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))
    (cons :d (cons 4 plist)))
(:D 4 :A 1 :B 2 :C 3)

* (let ((plist (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))
    (cons :d (cons 4 plist))
	plist)
(:A 1 :B 2 :C 3)

* (let ((plist (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))
    (append (list :d 4 :e 5) plist))
(:D 4 :E 5 :A 1 :B 2 :C 3)

* (let ((plist (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))
    (append (list :d 4 :e 5) plist)
	plist)
(:A 1 :B 2 :C 3)
```

## Exercise 1.5.4

**Even More PLISTs**

Its possible to mutate `plists`, as most other values, by using `setf`.

```lisp
* (defparameter *plist* (list :a 1 :b 'two :c "three"))
*PLIST*

* (getf *plist* :b)
TWO

* (setf (getf *plist* :b) 'three)
THREE

* (getf *plist* :b)
THREE

* *plist*
(:A 1 :B THREE :C "three")
```

The key you set this way doesn't need to exist already.

```lisp
* (setf (getf *plist* :d) 71)
71

* (getf *plist* :d)
71
```

but the order of new keys may surprise you.

```lisp
* *plist*
(:D 71 :A 1 :B THREE :C "three")
```

In order to *remove* keys from a `plist`, you'd have to remove the desired key and its related value. The destructive procedure `remf` does exactly that.

```lisp
* (remf *plist* :b)
T

* *plist*
(:D 71 :A 1 :C "three")
```

## Exercise 1.5.5

**ALISTs**

An `alist` is a list of Cons-Cells. The first element of each Cons-Cell is taken to be the key, while the rest is taken to be the value.

```lisp
* '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))
((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3))

* (list (cons :foo "a") (cons :bar "b"))
((:FOO . "a") (:BAR . "b"))
```

Calling the function `assoc` on a key and an `alist` will try to find that key in the `alist`. If it is found, the return value will be the whole Cons-Cell in question.

```lisp
* (assoc 'b '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
(B . 2)

* (assoc 'a '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
(A . 1)
```

Trying this on a malformed `alist`s may yield errors, though they won't be quite as specific as the ones thrown for malformed `plist`s.

```lisp
* (assoc 'a '((a . 1) (b . 2) c))
(A . 1)

* (assoc 'c '((a . 1) (b . 2) c))

  The value C is not of type LIST.
     [Condition of type TYPE-ERROR]
```

Specifically, that `error` refers to that trailing `c` in our `alist`. This is because `assoc` compares the given key with the `car` of each element in the given list. If a particular element is not a `list` (or `cons`), you can't take its `car`, which means the selector will error.

## Exercise 1.5.6

**More ALISTs**

As with `plist`s, `alist`s may be heterogenously typed.

```lisp
* '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three) (d . #(#\f #\o #\u #\r)))
((A . 1) (B . "two") (C . THREE) (D . #(#\f #\o #\u #\r)))

* (assoc 'b '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three) (d . #(#\f #\o #\u #\r))))
(B . "two")

* (assoc 'd '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three) (d . #(#\f #\o #\u #\r))))
(D . #(#\f #\o #\u #\r))
```

and this again applies to both keys and values.

```lisp
* '((1 . a) ("two" . b) (three . c) (#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . d))
((1 . A) ("two" . B) (THREE . C) (#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . D))

* (assoc 'three '((1 . a) ("two" . b) (three . c) (#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . d)))
(THREE . C)

* (assoc 1 '((1 . a) ("two" . b) (three . c) (#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . d)))
(1 . A)
```

*Un*like with `plist`s, compound keys might be useful. Because `assoc` accepts a `test` (or `test-not`) argument, which lets you specify the test to run when determining key equality.

```lisp
* (assoc "two" '((1 . a) ("two" . b) (three . c) (#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . d)) :test #'equal)
("two" . B)

* (assoc #(#\f #\o #\u #\r) '((1 . a) ("two" . b) (three . c) (#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . d)) :test #'equalp)
(#(#\f #\o #\u #\r) . D)
```

Because `alist`s are lists of `cons` cells, you can use `cons` to functionally insert items

```lisp
* '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three))
((A . 1) (B . "two") (C . THREE))

* (let ((alist '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three))))
    (cons (cons 'd 'four) alist))
((D . FOUR) (A . 1) (B . "two") (C . THREE))

* (let ((alist '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three))))
    (cons (cons 'd 'four) alist)
	alist)
((A . 1) (B . "two") (C . THREE))
```

Similarly, you can use the standard `remove`/`remove-if` functions on `alist`s transparently.

```lisp
* (remove 'b '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three)) :key #'car)
((A . 1) (C . THREE))

* (remove-if (lambda (p) (eq 'c (car p))) '((a . 1) (b . "two") (c . three)))
((A . 1) (B . "two"))

* (remove-if
    (lambda (pair)
      (numberp (car pair)))
    '((a . 1) (1 . a) (b . "two") (2 . b) (c . three)))
((A . 1) (B . "two") (C . THREE))
```

## Exercise 1.5.7

**Even More ALISTs**

You can mutate `alist`s, just as you can mutate almost everything else.

```lisp
* (defparameter *alist* '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
*ALIST*

* (setf (cdr (assoc 'b *alist*)) 42)
42

* *alist*
((A . 1) (B . 42) (C . 3))
```

Though, unlike with `plist`s, the key you're mutating must already exist.

```lisp
* (setf (cdr (assoc 'foo *alist*)) 43)

  The value NIL is not of type CONS.
     [Condition of type TYPE-ERROR]
```

It is possible to add keys to an `alist`, but you need to be more explicit about it.

```lisp
* (push '(foo . 43) *alist*)
((FOO . 43) (A . 1) (B . 42) (C . 3))

* *alist*
((FOO . 43) (A . 1) (B . 42) (C . 3))
```

You can also remove keys using `setf` and the functional approaches we discussed in the previous section.

```lisp
* (setf *alist* (remove 'b *alist* :key #'car))
((FOO . 43) (A . 1) (C . 3))

* *alist*
((FOO . 43) (A . 1) (C . 3))
```

## Exercise 1.5.8

**Efficiency, and Alternatives to ALISTs and PLISTs**

We mentioned earlier that the `alist` and `plist` were both representation of linear-lookup key--value structures. This is because they both work naively. That is, doing a lookup entails traversing the entire structure and comparing each key in turn until one matches the key we're looking for...

```lisp
* (trace eq)
(EQ)

* (assoc 'b '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3) (d . 4)) :test #'eq)
  0: (EQ B A)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ B B)
  0: EQ returned T
(B . 2)

* (assoc 'd '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3) (d . 4)) :test #'eq)
  0: (EQ D A)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ D B)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ D C)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ D D)
  0: EQ returned T
(D . 4)
```

... or until we reach the end of the list.

```lisp
* (assoc 'foo '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3) (d . 4)) :test #'eq)
  0: (EQ FOO A)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ FOO B)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ FOO C)
  0: EQ returned NIL
  0: (EQ FOO D)
  0: EQ returned NIL
NIL

* (untrace eq)
T
```

This is often Good Enough, but there are times when you care about lookup performance, and might be willing to sacrifice simplicity of implementation. No, we're not implementing `hash-table`s. They're already provided as part of the language (though that won't stop us later). Lets take a look at some tree structures.


## Exercise 1.5.9

**Trees**

If we pick keys so that we can *sort* them instead of merely comparing them for equality, we could use a tree structure rather than a plain list. Though we do need to do a bit more work. A tree is typically recursively defined as either

1. A value followed by two trees (a left branch and a right branch)
2. The terminal value (which marks the end of our tree)

Which we can represent as things like

```lisp
* '((1 . a) nil nil)
((1 . A) NIL NIL)

* '((2 . b) ((1 . a) nil nil) ((3 . c) nil ((4 . d) nil nil)))
((2 . B) ((1 . A) NIL NIL) ((3 . C) NIL ((4 . D) NIL NIL)))
```

This is not the only possible tree representation, nor necessarily the best. We'll reserve others for later on. You can see that our "value" is a key--value pair in the style of an `alist` and our terminal value is `NIL`. Also, note that our keys are sorted. That is, everything in the left branch of a particular tree has a *lesser* key than the "value" of that tree, while everything in the right branch has a *greater* key. This is the property that will let us do faster lookups. Ideally, it will let us cut half of the remaining search space out with each comparison.

Here's `lookup`:

```lisp
* (defun lookup (key sorted-tree)
    (let ((k (caar sorted-tree)))
      (cond ((null sorted-tree) nil)
	    ((> k key)
	     (lookup key (second sorted-tree)))
	    ((< k key)
	     (lookup key (third sorted-tree)))
	    (t
	     (first sorted-tree)))))
LOOKUP

* (trace lookup)
(LOOKUP)

* (lookup 4 '((2 . b) ((1 . a) nil nil) ((3 . c) nil ((4 . d) nil nil))))
  0: (LOOKUP 4 ((2 . B) ((1 . A) NIL NIL) ((3 . C) NIL ((4 . D) NIL NIL))))
    1: (LOOKUP 4 ((3 . C) NIL ((4 . D) NIL NIL)))
      2: (LOOKUP 4 ((4 . D) NIL NIL))
      2: LOOKUP returned (4 . D)
    1: LOOKUP returned (4 . D)
  0: LOOKUP returned (4 . D)
(4 . D)
```

Notice that we don't compare against all of the preceding elements in order to get to ours. We only compare against 3. A tree of four key--value pairs isn't the best demonstration of this, of course.

## Exercise 1.5.10

**More Trees**

Since we're doing more work on trees, we may as well go [SICP](TODO link)-style and define the functional interface.

```lisp
* (defun tree (val left right)
    (list val left right))
TREE

* (defun tree-value (tree) (first tree))
TREE-VALUE

* (defun tree-left (tree) (second tree))
TREE-LEFT

* (defun tree-right (tree) (third tree))
TREE-RIGHT

* (defun lookup (key tree)
    (if (null tree)
        nil
        (let ((k (car (tree-value tree))))
          (cond ((> k key) (lookup key (tree-left tree)))
                ((< k key) (lookup key (tree-right tree)))
                (t (tree-value tree))))))
; STYLE-WARNING: redefining COMMON-LISP-USER::LOOKUP in DEFUN
LOOKUP
```

Now that we have that, a naive `insert` looks like

```lisp
* (defun insert (key value tree)
    (if (null tree)
        (tree (cons key value) nil nil)
        (let ((k (car (tree-value tree))))
          (cond ((> k key)
                 (tree (tree-value tree)
                       (insert key value (tree-left tree))
                       (tree-right tree)))
                ((< k key)
                 (tree (tree-value tree)
                       (tree-left tree)
                       (insert key value (tree-right tree))))
                (t tree)))))
INSERT
```

We can use that insert on this specially-ordered `alist` to give us a reasonably balanced tree.

```lisp
* (defparameter *lst* '((5 . e) (3 . c) (4 . d) (2 . b) (1 . a) (7 . g) (6 . f) (8 . h) (9 . i) (10 . j)))
*LST*

* (reduce
    (lambda (memo pair)
      (insert (car pair) (cdr pair) memo))
    *lst* :initial-value nil)
((5 . E) ((3 . C) ((2 . B) ((1 . A) NIL NIL) NIL) ((4 . D) NIL NIL))
 ((7 . G) ((6 . F) NIL NIL) ((8 . H) NIL ((9 . I) NIL ((10 . J) NIL NIL)))))

* (defparameter *tree*
    (reduce
     (lambda (memo pair)
       (insert (car pair) (cdr pair) memo))
     *lst* :initial-value nil))
```

And, just so that we're comparing like-for-like, here's a recursive definition of `assoc`

```lisp
* (defun rec-assoc (key alist)
	(cond ((null alist) nil)
          ((eq key (caar alist)) (car alist))
          (t (rec-assoc key (cdr alist)))))
REC-ASSOC
```

Now, lets compare lookup steps involved.

```lisp
* (trace lookup rec-assoc)
(LOOKUP REC-ASSOC)

* (rec-assoc 9 *lst*)
  0: (REC-ASSOC 9
                ((5 . E) (3 . C) (4 . D) (2 . B) (1 . A) (7 . G) (6 . F)
                 (8 . H) (9 . I) (10 . J)))
    1: (REC-ASSOC 9
                  ((3 . C) (4 . D) (2 . B) (1 . A) (7 . G) (6 . F) (8 . H)
                   (9 . I) (10 . J)))
      2: (REC-ASSOC 9
                    ((4 . D) (2 . B) (1 . A) (7 . G) (6 . F) (8 . H) (9 . I)
                     (10 . J)))
        3: (REC-ASSOC 9
                      ((2 . B) (1 . A) (7 . G) (6 . F) (8 . H) (9 . I) (10 . J)))
          4: (REC-ASSOC 9 ((1 . A) (7 . G) (6 . F) (8 . H) (9 . I) (10 . J)))
            5: (REC-ASSOC 9 ((7 . G) (6 . F) (8 . H) (9 . I) (10 . J)))
              6: (REC-ASSOC 9 ((6 . F) (8 . H) (9 . I) (10 . J)))
                7: (REC-ASSOC 9 ((8 . H) (9 . I) (10 . J)))
                  8: (REC-ASSOC 9 ((9 . I) (10 . J)))
                  8: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
                7: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
              6: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
            5: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
          4: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
        3: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
      2: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
    1: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
  0: REC-ASSOC returned (9 . I)
(9 . I)

* (lookup 9 *tree*)
  0: (LOOKUP 9
             ((5 . E)
              ((3 . C) ((2 . B) ((1 . A) NIL NIL) NIL) ((4 . D) NIL NIL))
              ((7 . G) ((6 . F) NIL NIL)
               ((8 . H) NIL ((9 . I) NIL ((10 . J) NIL NIL))))))
    1: (LOOKUP 9
               ((7 . G) ((6 . F) NIL NIL)
                ((8 . H) NIL ((9 . I) NIL ((10 . J) NIL NIL)))))
      2: (LOOKUP 9 ((8 . H) NIL ((9 . I) NIL ((10 . J) NIL NIL))))
        3: (LOOKUP 9 ((9 . I) NIL ((10 . J) NIL NIL)))
        3: LOOKUP returned (9 . I)
      2: LOOKUP returned (9 . I)
    1: LOOKUP returned (9 . I)
  0: LOOKUP returned (9 . I)
(9 . I)

* (untrace lookup rec-assoc)
T
```

The tree structure saves us a bit of work in a situation like this. And, if we can arrange for our lookup tree to be balanced or almost balanced, we'll save *more* work the bigger our data-set becomes.

## Exercise 1.5.11

**Tries**

If we can pick keys so that they're not merely sortable, but also *decomposable*, we can save a bit more time and space by using Tries *(As an aside, "Tree" and "Trie" are pronounced the same way. This is doubly annoying because, as you'll see in a moment, a Trie is a kind of Tree. So you can't even disambiguate by saying things like "Trie, the data structure". You'll sometimes hear Tries referred to as "Prefix trees", which may or may not help the situation)*.

A Trie is a value and a (possibly empty) dictionary of key parts to Tries. Which can be represented as:

```lisp
* '(nil nil)
(NIL NIL)

* '(nil ((#\o nil ((#\n "activated; not off" ((#\e "the english name for the numeral 1" NIL)))))))
(NIL
 ((#\o NIL
   ((#\n "activated; not off"
     ((#\e "the english name for the numeral 1")))))))

* '(nil ((1 nil ((2 nil ((3 "ah ah ah." nil)))))))
(NIL ((1 NIL ((2 NIL ((3 "ah ah ah." NIL)))))))

* '(nil
    ((this nil
      ((sentence nil
        ((is nil
          ((a nil ((key "This sentence is a key" nil)))
           (not nil ((a nil ((key "This sentence is NOT a key" nil)))))
           (meaningless t nil)))))))))
(NIL
 ((THIS NIL
   ((SENTENCE NIL
     ((IS NIL

        (NOT NIL ((A NIL ((KEY "This sentence is NOT a key" NIL)))))
        (MEANINGLESS T NIL)))))))))
```

Looking up a key in a Trie means taking the decomposed key, and looking up each key part level-wise.

```lisp
* (defun trie-lookup (key-parts trie)
    (if (null key-parts)
        (first trie)
        (let ((next (cdr (assoc (car key-parts) (second trie)))))
	      (when next
	        (trie-lookup (cdr key-parts) next)))))
TRIE-LOOKUP

* (defparameter *trie*
    '(nil ((#\o nil ((#\n "activated; not off" ((#\e "the english name for the numeral 1" NIL))))))))
*TRIE*

* (trie-lookup '(#\o #\n) *trie*)
"activated; not off"

* (trie-lookup '(#\o #\n #\e) *trie*)
"the english name for the numeral 1"

* (trie-lookup '(#\o #\n #\e #\i #\r #\o #\s) *trie*)
NIL

* (trie-lookup '(#\t #\w #\o) *trie*)
NIL
```

The idea here is that any common prefixes among keys are collapsed, and that some extra data about a particular sequence is held as the `value`. The best casefor a lookup is a key that shares no prefix with anything in the Trie. The worst case is a key that shares a long prefix, since we need to traverse the entire prefix before discovering the absence.

## Exercise 1.5.12

**More Tries**

So lets go explicit-interface-style on this problem.

```lisp
* (defun trie (val map)
    (list val map))
TRIE

* (defun empty-trie ()
    (trie nil nil))
EMPTY-TRIE

* (empty-trie)
(NIL NIL)

* (defun trie-value (trie)
    (first trie))
TRIE-VALUE

* (defun trie-table (trie)
    (second trie))
TRIE-TABLE

* (defun trie-assoc (key-part trie)
    (cdr (assoc key-part (trie-table trie))))
TRIE-ASSOC

* (defun trie-lookup (key-parts trie)
    (if (null key-parts)
        (trie-value trie)
        (let ((next (trie-assoc (first key-parts) trie)))
          (when next
            (trie-lookup (rest key-parts) next)))))
```

Those are the basic getters. And nothing really fancy has been said yet. You can see why I'd leave them out for the initial pass based on their trivial nature. Insertion is less trivial to implement, but still conceptually simple.

```lisp
* (defun trie-alist-insert (k trie alist)
    (cons (cons k trie)
	      (remove k alist :key #'car)))
TRIE-ALIST-INSERT

* (defun trie-insert (key value trie)
    (if key
        (let* ((k (first key))
               (next (trie-assoc k trie)))
          (trie (trie-value trie)
                (trie-alist-insert
                 k
                 (trie-insert
                  (rest key) value
                  (or next (trie nil nil)))
                 (trie-table trie))))
        (trie value (trie-table trie))))
TRIE-INSERT

* (trie-insert (coerce "once" 'list) "one time, and one time only" *trie*)
(NIL
 ((#\o NIL
   ((#\n "activated; not off"
     ((#\c NIL ((#\e "one time, and one time only" NIL)))
      (#\e "the english name for the numeral 1" NIL)))))))
```

In order to insert a new value, associated with a particular key, we traverse that keys' parts and either recur to the next level of the `trie` by looking up the current part, or freshly insert that part into the current `trie` table. If we run out of key to traverse, we insert the new value, replacing an existing one if necessary.

```lisp
* *trie*
(NIL
 ((#\o NIL
   ((#\n "activated; not off"
     ((#\e "the english name for the numeral 1" NIL)))))))

* (trie-insert (coerce "on" 'list) "switched on" *trie*)
(NIL
 ((#\o NIL
   ((#\n "switched on"
     ((#\e "the english name for the numeral 1" NIL)))))))
```

Though of course, as always, we're not doing this replacement destructively.

```lisp
* *trie*
(NIL
 ((#\o NIL
   ((#\n "activated; not off"
     ((#\e "the english name for the numeral 1" NIL)))))))
```

Now, lets do the same comparison we did earlier in the Trees section.

```
* (defun rec-string-assoc (key alist)
	(cond ((null alist) nil)
          ((string= key (caar alist)) (car alist))

```

As you can see, we've got a similar situation here. When using a Trie to store our keys, we can essentially ignore groups of values for the purposes of doing a lookup. Which lets us do lookups in much better than linear time.

## Exercise 1.5.13

**Even More Tries**

Completely apart from basic lookup performance, which is good but not all-important, Tries let us compute completions fairly cheaply. In the definition of `trie-lookup` we've already seen, walking the trie is conflated with getting a particular value out...

```lisp
(defun trie-lookup (key-parts trie)
  (if (null key-parts)
      (trie-value trie)
      (let ((next (trie-assoc (first key-parts) trie)))
	(when next
	  (trie-lookup (rest key-parts) next)))))
```

...but it doesn't have to be.

```lisp
* (defun trie-walk (key-parts trie)
    (if (null key-parts)
        trie
        (let ((next (trie-assoc (first key-parts) trie)))
	      (when next
	        (trie-walk (rest key-parts) next)))))
TRIE-WALK

* (trie-walk (coerce "on" 'list) *trie*)
("activated; not off"
 ((#\c NIL ((#\e "one time, and one time only" NIL)))
  (#\e "the English name for the numeral 1" ((#\s "plural of 'one'" NIL)))))

* (defun trie-lookup (key-parts trie)
    (trie-value (trie-walk key-parts trie)))
TRIE-LOOKUP
```

With a definition of `trie-walk` so decoupled, we can now do the pre-order traversal and come out with a list of contained keys that start with the components we pass in.

```lisp
* (defun trie-completions (key-parts trie)
    (labels ((recur (path trie)
               (let ((rest (loop for (k . sub-trie) in (trie-table trie)
                              append (recur (append path (list k)) sub-trie)) ))
                 (if (trie-value trie)
                     (cons path rest)
                     rest))))
      (recur key-parts (trie-walk key-parts trie))))
TRIE-COMPLETIONS

* (trie-completions (coerce "on" 'list) *trie*)
((#\o #\n) (#\o #\n #\c #\e) (#\o #\n #\e) (#\o #\n #\e #\s))
```

There are a couple of other ways we can vary Trie implementations. Firstly, we can change the representation of our `trie-map`. In all of the above examples, they're `alist`s, but that's not a requirement. It might be reasonable to make them `hash-table`s, or objects, or Trees, or even sub-Tries depending on our situation. Secondly, except for a few brief examples back in exercise 1.5.11, we've been dealing with Tries whose keys are strings and decompose into characters. Other options are possible; for example the top level might be a phrase that decomposes into words, or numbers that decompose into bits.

We won't be investigating any of the variations at the moment though; that might happen in later chapters.

## Exercise 1.5.14

**Hash Tables**

Hash Tables are the standard constant-time lookup structure you're familiar with from other languages.

```lisp
* (make-hash-table)
#<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQL :COUNT 0 {1003F59933}>
```

Unlike the other table structures we've taken a look at, there isn't really a non-destructive way to interact with a Hash Table. If you want to insert keys, you mutate the argument. You *could* copy the table out manually and add your new key to the copy, but that makes insertion take linear time. And you still have to do it manually; you don't get it for free the way you might with a Trie or `alist`.

```lisp
* (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
	      (gethash 'b hash) 2
	      (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    hash)
#<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQL :COUNT 3 {1004099983}>

* (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
	      (gethash 'b hash) 2
	      (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    (gethash 'b hash))
2
T
```

There's no functional way to remove keys from hash tables either, other than the mentioned table-copying approach. Removing a key mutates the argument.

```lisp
* (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
          (gethash 'b hash) 2
		  (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    (remhash 'b hash)
    hash)
#<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQL :COUNT 2 {100758CFB3}>
```

There's a few different ways of iterating over a Hash Table, depending on specifically what you're up to. If you're looking to make some destructive changes, or maybe just print pairs, there's `maphash`.

```lisp
* (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
          (gethash 'b hash) 2
		  (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    (maphash (lambda (k v) (format t "~a -> ~a~%" k v)) hash))
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
NIL
```

Note that `maphash` doesn't collect results, so you couldn't convert a Hash Table to an `alist` by calling it with `cons`.

```lisp
* (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
          (gethash 'b hash) 2
		  (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    (maphash #'cons hash))
NIL
```

If you wanted that, you'd either need to use some functions from [`alexandria`](TODO link to alexandria chapter), or a specific piece of [`loop`](TODO link to the loop section (assuming there is one))...

```lisp
* (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
          (gethash 'b hash) 2
		  (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    (loop for k being the hash-keys of hash
       for v being the hash-values of hash
       collect (cons k v)))
((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3))
```

... or you'd set up your own accumulator explicitly.

```lisp
* (let ((hash (make-hash-table))
        (acc nil))
    (setf (gethash 'a hash) 1
          (gethash 'b hash) 2
		  (gethash 'c hash) 3)
    (maphash (lambda (k v) (push (cons k v) acc)) hash)
    acc)
((C . 3) (B . 2) (A . 1))
```

## Exercise 1.5.15

**Object Reference**

Speaking of Objects, there are two constructs in Common Lisp that give you some behaviors you might expect from them; `class`es and `struct`s. This exercise won't be a complete treatment, but will show you the basics.

```lisp
* (defclass foo ()
    ((a :initform 1)
     (b :initform 2)
     (c :initform 3)))
#<STANDARD-CLASS FOO>

* (make-instance 'foo)
#<FOO {10058567E3}>

* (slot-value (make-instance 'foo) 'a)
1

* (slot-value (make-instance 'foo) 'c)
3
```

Instead of using `slot-value`, it's possible to define reader and accessor functions for individual slots.

```lisp
* (defclass bar ()
	   ((a :initform 1 :reader a)
	    (b :initform 2 :accessor b)
	    (c :initform 3)))
#<STANDARD-CLASS BAR>

* (a (make-instance 'bar))
1

* (b (make-instance 'bar))
2
```

A `reader` is basically just a getter function. You can't set its value directly.

```lisp
* (defparameter *instance* (make-instance 'bar))
*INSTANCE*

* *instance*
#<BAR {1005F806E3}>

* (a *instance*)
1

* (setf (a *instance*) 32)
 Evaluation aborted on #<UNDEFINED-FUNCTION (SETF A) {1005DCB833}>.
```

An `accessor` on the other hand, is both a getter and a setter. So you can both read and assign through the interface it sets up.

```lisp
* (b *instance*)
2

* (setf (b *instance*) 32)
32

* (b *instance*)
32
```

This isn't the same as setting public or private methods though. Even if you don't expose an accessor, it's possible to set a slots' value using the `slot-value` function.

```lisp
* (setf (slot-value *instance* 'a) 16)
16

* (a *instance*)
16
```

Unlike the key--value constructs we've seen so far, there isn't an easy and portable (across Common Lisp implementations) way to iterate over keys and values. If you want that, you're stuck doing something a touch hacky. In real life, it would be *a bit* less hacky (see [here](https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-mop/blob/master/package.lisp) for what you'd really do), but we haven't covered packages yet.

```lisp
* (defun class-slots (class)
    #+openmcl-native-threads (ccl:class-slots class)
    #+cmu (pcl:class-slots class)
    #+sbcl (sb-pcl:class-slots class)
    #+lispworks (hcl:class-slots class)
    #+allegro (mop:class-slots class)
    #+clisp (clos:class-slots class))
CLASS-SLOTS

* (defun slot-definition-name (slot)
    #+openmcl-native-threads (ccl:slot-definition-name slot)
    #+cmu (pcl:slot-definition-name slot)
    #+sbcl (sb-pcl:slot-definition-name slot)
    #+lispworks (hcl:slot-definition-name slot)
    #+allegro (mop:slot-definition-name slot)
    #+clisp (clos:slot-definition-name slot))

* (defun map-slots (fn instance)
    (loop for slot in (class-slots (class-of instance))
       for slot-name = (slot-definition-name slot)
       collect (when (slot-boundp instance slot-name)
	             (funcall fn slot-name (slot-value instance slot-name)))))
MAP-SLOTS

* (map-slots (lambda (k v) (list k v)) *instance*)
((A 16) (B 32) (C 3))
```
