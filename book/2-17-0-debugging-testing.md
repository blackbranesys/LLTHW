# Debugging and Unit Testing

No matter what you do, how hard you try, your code will eventually break.  You, or someone else maintaining your code, will make a mistake, or overlook that one use-case that brings your whole program down.  It happens.  Software is fragile by nature, and programmers *are* only human.  So remember this: the debugger is your friend.  It's only there to help you.

You've seen the interactive debugger enough times by now to have a general idea how it works, but Lisp has a lot more tools to help you debug as you go; you've already seen how to write and handle Conditions in Chapter 2.11---but that's just a small piece of a much bigger puzzle.
